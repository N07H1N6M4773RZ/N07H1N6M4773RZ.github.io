okay so basically, throughout the next one or two months we\'92re going to focus on getting things organized. mainly we\'92re going to try to get a single out and promotion going for it. so the full from scratch to finish will take us around a month or two. so by this time next month we\'92re going to have the full mix and master of whatever song we decide is good enough, done. for another month we\'92ll focus on getting promotion and get it popping\'92, from there we drop the track and try to get it as big as possible. our main goal is for with in a year to have a manager and start consistently releasing music and squeeze in anything else we want to do. we realize that we have to put ourselves into a box for now to be able to market the group as something specific. we need to create an audience that likes us for something and then once we have a centralized group of supporters and followers we can start branching out to other things. there\'92s a lot of thought going into everything that we will be doing from here on out and we hope to make something of ourselves sometime soon. we know we have the ability to be great. we can do a lot, we have the persistence and the courage to follow our dreams and try to make something of nothing. <3\

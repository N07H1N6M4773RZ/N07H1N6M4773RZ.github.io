<p class="p2"><span class="s1">we are a collective or creators who produce music, visual art and anything else we want really. the group consists of 5 members at the moment. â€¢Mo - Mo is a multi-instrumentalist, singer/songwriter that started making music back in high school. he's been evolving ever since. mo has released a lot of music scattered around the internet but to make things simple [here](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0V8LWLEPPCInaMQtUxnm9P?si=qOmgcfdVS4m_0ZUXBmI0Gg) is a link to his spotify page. â€¢Alex/Jay - tbc.. â€¢Wyatt/ptr - That's not really his name, but he goes by many names so who's really keeping count? He's a graphic designer that's made plenty of things for the Rutos since the beginning and continues to produce cover art for the Rutos. His secondary specialty is clothing design and has made graphics for a couple brands as of April 2019 [Â¹](https://www.instagram.com/goldenadvantage) [Â²](https://www.instagram.com/demolish.wear/) â€¢David - David is a producer and songwriter who has worked closely with Mo[Â³](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpGMOLJlw6I/).

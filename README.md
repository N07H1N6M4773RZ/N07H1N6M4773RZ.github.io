He's a graphic designer that's made plenty of things for the Rutos since the beginning and continues to produce cover art for the Rutos. His secondary specialty is clothing design and has made graphics for a couple brands as of April 2019 [¹](https://www.instagram.com/goldenadvantage) [²](https://www.instagram.com/demolish.wear/)

David has also produced instrumentals and orchistrated drums for Eric Bellinger[⁴](https://open.spotify.com/track/2XVgOSirFERy70ZpRlWufD), but we don't really like to talk about that.
